# Introduction to Generative AI: Quiz

1. What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?
```bash
A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.
```

The model is not trained on enough data
```

4. What is a prompt?
```bash
A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.
```

5. What are foundation models in Generative AI?
```bash
A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted‚Äù (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.
```
