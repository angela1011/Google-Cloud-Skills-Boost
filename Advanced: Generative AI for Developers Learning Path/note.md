# Module 1: Quiz
1. A customer is working with a large dataset of healthcare records to develop a diagnostic AI model. They want to ensure privacy of sensitive data, by restricting the contribution of specific data on the model during training. Which privacy-focused technique would be best for the customer?
```bash
DP-SGD (Differentially Private - Stochastic Gradient Descent)
```

2. In machine learning, privacy measures often introduce trade-offs with other important factors. Which of the following does NOT represent a typical trade-off?
```bash

Privacy and Transparency
```

3. You've applied various de-identification techniques to a customer dataset containing sensitive information before using it to train an AI model. Which of the following concepts should you use to evaluate the suitability of your de-identification techniques?
```bash
Reversibility and referential integrity.
```

# Module 2: Quiz
1. Your manager asked you to lead a project to research the key considerations in AI safety and develop a failure mode catalog to assist evaluate safety in Generative AI products. Which of the following should not be included as a failure mode?
```bash
Citation
```

2. You want to embed the concept of safety into a pre-trained LLM by fine-tuning it. You have a dataset of prompts and pairs of possible answers, along with labels created by human safety evaluators indicating their preference for one answer over the other. Which technique is the most suitable for fine-tuning the LLM in this scenario?
```bash
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
```

3. You're pitching an AI-powered customer support solution to a potential client. Their company handles highly sensitive user information, and they have reservations about potential risks associated with AI systems. To address their concerns and win their trust, which key message about AI safety would be most effective to emphasize?
```bash
"Adherence to AI safety principles helps us build reliable systems that minimize unexpected errors, safeguarding your customer data."
```
