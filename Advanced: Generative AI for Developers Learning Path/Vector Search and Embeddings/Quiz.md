# Vector Search and Embeddings: Quiz

1. Which of the following is correct to compare between vector search and traditional keyword search?
```bash
Vector search addresses semantic similarity and is good at solving ambiguous queries, whereas traditional keyword search is good at solving precise queries.
```

2. What is the process of encoding text data into vectors called?
```bash
Generating text embeddings.
```

3. What is the general process to build a search application by using Vertex AI Vector Search?
```bash
Encode data to embeddings, build an index, and search results.
```

4. What are the two main techniques used by ScaNN (Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor) to improve search performance in vector search?
```bash
Space pruning and data quantization
```

5. What are the two main technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to implement vector search effectively?
```bash
Encoding and indexing
```

6. What is the main purpose of using distance metrics like dot product distance in vector search?
```bash
Measure the distance between vectors in terms of semantic similarity.
```

7. What is the main benefit of using vector search in RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to address LLM (Large Language Models) hallucination?
```bash
It allows the LLM to access real-time information for fact-checking.
```
