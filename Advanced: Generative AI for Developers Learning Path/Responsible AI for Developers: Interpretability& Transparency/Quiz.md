# Responsible AI for Developers: Interpretability & Transparency: Quiz

1. Your manager is a strong advocate for responsible AI development. During a project review, they emphasize the importance of transparency and documentation around the dataset you're using and the resulting AI model. They want to know what steps you're taking to ensure this. Which of the following tools or techniques are you using to provide a clear understanding of your dataset and model?
```bash
Data card, Model card
```

2. You're working on an image classification model for identifying different types of clouds. During testing, you notice some strange results. The model seems to be focusing on irrelevant areas of the images (like background objects) instead of the actual cloud features. To understand why your model is behaving this way, which of the following tools or techniques would be the most helpful?
```bash
XRAI (eXplainable Region-based Artificial Intelligence)
```

3. As an AI engineering team manager, you're giving a presentation to explain why interpretability and transparency in AI development is important for engineers. Which of the following statements would be best to include in your slides?
```bash
Understand model behaviors
```
