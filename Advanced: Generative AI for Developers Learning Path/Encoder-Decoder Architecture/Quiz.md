# Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Quiz

1. What is the purpose of the decoder in an encoder-decoder architecture?
```bash
To generate the output sequence from the vector representation
To predict the next word in the output sequence
```

2. What are two ways to generate text from a trained encoder-decoder model at serving time?
```bash
Greedy search and beam search
```

3. What is the name of the machine learning architecture that takes a sequence of words as input and outputs a sequence of words?
```bash
Encoder-decoder
```

4. What is the purpose of the encoder in an encoder-decoder architecture?
```bash
To convert the input sequence into a vector representation
```

5. What is the difference between greedy search and beam search?
```bash
Greedy search always selects the word with the highest probability, whereas beam search considers multiple possible words and selects the one with the highest combined probability.
```
