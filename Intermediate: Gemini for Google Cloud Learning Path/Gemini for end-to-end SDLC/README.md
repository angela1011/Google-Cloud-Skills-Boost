# Gemini for end-to-end SDLC

In this course, you learn how Gemini, a generative AI-powered collaborator from Google Cloud, helps you use Google products and services to develop, test, deploy, and manage applications. With help from Gemini, you learn how to develop and build a web application, fix errors in the application, develop tests, and query data. Using a hands-on lab, you experience how Gemini improves the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

Duet AI was renamed to Gemini, our next-generation model.
