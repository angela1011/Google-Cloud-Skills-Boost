# Gemini for Cloud Architects

In this course, you learn how Gemini, a generative AI-powered collaborator from Google Cloud, helps administrators provision infrastructure. You learn how to prompt Gemini to explain infrastructure, deploy GKE clusters and update existing infrastructure. Using a hands-on lab, you experience how Gemini improves the GKE deployment workflow.

Duet AI was renamed to Gemini, our next-generation model.
